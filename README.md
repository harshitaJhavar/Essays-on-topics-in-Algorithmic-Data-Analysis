# Essays-on-topics-in-Algorithmic-Data-Analysis
Here are some of the essay reports I wrote after critically analysing papers in specific domains of algorthmic data analysis.

Topic 1: Deep Learning: The Best Thing Since Sliced Bread or Just Another Bottle of Snake Oil?
To answer to this assignment, you must have a good understanding of machine learning techniques in general, and deep learning techniques in special.
The most talked-about data analysis topic of last year or two has definitely been deep learning. Many researchers have claimed that they have obtained impressive results with deep learning: they can classify images [7], write LaTeX articles that almost compile [8], dream up images [9], and even win the best humans on GO [10].
Explain what is deep learning and how did the cited applications use various deep learning techniques. Do they all use one unified "deep learning algorithm"? If not, explain the differences and similarities between the approaches. Are they all really only about deep learning? For example, in your opinion, is the AlphaGo primarily deep learning or reinforcement learning method? Did it do all feature selection automatically, or were there hand-crafted rules?
And have all these applications really been resounding success stories? Read also [11] and [12]. How do they effect on your opinion on deep learning? Does deep learning have anything to do with data mining and knowledge discovery? Is deep learning the best thing since sliced bread, just another bottle of snake oil, ill-defined term under which people place all kinds of research, or what?

Topic 2: Look, Mom, no hands!
One of the advantages of using Minimum Description Length (MDL) [1] is that it allows to define parameter-free methods [2]. Some people go as far as claiming this is the future of data mining [3] as it allows for true exploratory data mining. Is this so? Where did the parameters go, and what about any assumptions? Is MDL a magic wand? What if we do not like what MDL says is the best? Discuss critically.
